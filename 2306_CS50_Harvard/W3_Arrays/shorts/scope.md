# Scope

ðŸ“ž Think of it like which part of the code can communicate with other parts

Variable scope
"Scope is a characteristic of a variable that defines from which functiosn that variable can be accessed."

- Local variable
  -- Can only be accessed within the functions in which they are created

- Global variable
  -- All encompassing.

--

The only way to overwrite a variable is to specify it within a function

Pay attention to scope especially when dealing with variable of the same name.
