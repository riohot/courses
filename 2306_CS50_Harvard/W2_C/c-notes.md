# C Notes

Do while loops

- Good for recursive questions or for when you need a desired input from users who may be
  bad actors

```bash
    int n
    do
    {
        c function()
    }
    while (argument);
    return n;
```

- In C an array index starts with 0 (Similar to some other programs)

- Look at code line by line. Computers and C language is VERY literal so see where the line breaks are
- What is happening at each line
- Analyse why certain things are happening - i.e Where are the curly braces are why
- IT helps to see Scratch blocks in regular code
- A lot of code simply breaks down to conditionalities (if else...)
