## Operators

Arithmetic operators

+, -, \*, /, %

Shorthand syntax

```bash
    x = x * 5;
    x *= 5;
```

```bash
    x++; aka x +=1;
    x--; aka x -=1;
```

Boolean - true or false

- We can use the result in variables
- Conditionals (A true or false to know whether to take a particular path)

- Every nonzero value is true
  0 = false
  > =1 = true

* Logical operators
  For in the road.

Logical and && (Both)
Logical OR ||
Logical not (bang) !

- Relational operators

* less than x < y
* less than or equal x <= y
* greater than x > y
* greater than or equal x >= y

Equality (x == y)
Inequality (x != y)
