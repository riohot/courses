## Data Types

Modern languages like PHP and JS you dont have to specify types for variables
In C you do the first time you use it.

- INT
  -- Integers always take up 4 bytes of memory (32 bits (4 x 8)
  -- Limited value -2b - - 2bn

- CHAR
  ASCII - a = 65, 0 = 48, etc

- FLOAT (aka real numbers)
  -- Decimal points
  --

- DOUBLE
  -- used for variables that will store floating-points
  -- Difference is they use extra 32 points

-- VOID (not a data type)
-- Functions can have a void return type. This just means they dont return a value
-- The Param. list of a function can also be void, simply meaning the fn takes no params.
-- ðŸ§  void = placeholder for "nothing"
-- (e.g if you want to print something)
