# Functions

## Definition:

Function is basically a set of statements that 1. takes inputs 2. performs some computation 3. Produces output.

```bash
    Return_data_type function_name(set_of_inputs);
```

Types: bool, int, long etc..

Note:

- When you define/declare you should mentioned the return TYPE in the arguments()
- When you call a function you dont have to do this

## Why

1. Re-usability - once defined it can be used over and over again
2. Abstratction - You dont have to worry about how it works under the hood
3. Restrict opportunity for errors

-

Paramters: variables in the function definition/declarion
Arguments: variables in the function call

-

The term void before a function in C indicates that the function does not return a value.
In C you need to explicitly state the data type so if there is nothing to return in the function you void it.
