#linear search

An algorithm is a step by step set of instructions for completing a tast
An algorithm we can use to find an element in an array

In PS-code

```bash
    Repeat, starting aat the first element:
        if the first elemetn is what youre looking for (the target) stop.
        Otherwise, move to the next element.
```

Best Case

- The target element is the 1st element of the array, and so we can stop looking immediately after we start

Worse Case

- The target element is the last of the array or doesnt exist at all
- Then what happens when we add a magnitude of elements to the array
