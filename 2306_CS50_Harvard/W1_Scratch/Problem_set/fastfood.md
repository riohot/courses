# Fast food invasion

Evade the fast food and try and consume as much fruit and vegetables as you can!

✅ Your project must use at least two sprites, at least one of which must not be a cat.
✅ Your project must have at least three scripts total (i.e., not necessarily three per sprite).
✅ Your project must use at least one conditional, at least one loop, and at least one variable.
✅ Your project must use at least one custom block that you have made yourself (via Make a Block), which must take at least one input.
✅ Your project should be more complex than most of those demonstrated in lecture (many of which, though instructive, were quite short) but it can be less complex than Oscartime and Ivy’s Hardest Game.

Notes

- Actions set on Flag or space bar
- Create each sprite seperately
  - but not individual sprites can have different costumes
- Define movements and store into blocks (functions)
  - using pick random
  - variables
- The screen is just an X-Y graph of pixels
- Randomising the time of drop 0f fruiit makes it seem random
- IF A touching B > do something
