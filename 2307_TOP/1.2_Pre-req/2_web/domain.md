# Domain Name

Human-readable address for any web-server

TLD - Top level domain (.com/org/ed etc)

You cant buy a domain name otherwise it would be like Real-estate (1000s of un-used empty) you can only rent them for a short period of time

_DNS refreshing_

DNS databses are stored on every DNS server worldwise, and all these servers refer to a few special servers called "authoritative name servers" or "Top-level DNS servers" - these are like the boss servers that manage the system
