# How does the Internet Work

üñº THE INTERNET IS A LARGE NETWORK OF COMPUTERS WHICH COMMUNICATE ALL TOGETHER

- When >1 computer needs to communicate, you have to link them, either physically (ethernet cable) or wirelessly (wifi, bluetooth)

- Lets say youre trying to connect >10 computers you'd need 45 cables with 9 plugs per computer. To solve this problem each computer on a network is connected to a _ROUTER_

A Router has one job - like a signaller at a railway station - to make sure that a message sent from 1 PC arrives at the right destination PC

- Once we add a router to the system out network of 10 PCs only requires 10 cables, a single plug for each PC and a router with 10 plugs

Adding more computers, millions, billions??

- a router is just a PC so they can also be connected to each other.

But how do we connect to the world

- A Telephone line is already connected to the world so this is a good use-case
- AKA Modem

How to send messages from our network to the network we want to reach?

- To do this we connect our network to an ISP (Internet service provider)

ISP: A company that managers some special routers that are all linked together and can also access other ISP routers.

üîç You must specify which IP you want to contact but since these are numbers we use
a DOMAIN NAME instead (note: you can actually go to a website using its IP)

INTERNET != WEB

INTERNET: A technical instrastructure which allows billions of PCs to link
WEB: A service built on top of this infrastructure (like email or IRC)

INTRANET: private network
EXTRANET: shared network used to safely share with clients, stakeholders etc..
